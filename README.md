# Software-Engineering-Ad-Auction-Project
As	people spend	significant	amounts	of	time	on	the	internet,	businesses	are	increasingly	turning	
to	online advertising to	gain	new	customers and	to	promote	their	products	and	services.	<br />

To enable	this,	many	popular	websites,	including	search	engines,	media	outlets,	blogs	and	social	
media	platforms,	allow	companies	to	place	adverts next	to	their	regular	content.
Typically,	this	advertising	space	is	sold	using	ad	auctions,	which	take	place	whenever	a	website	
user	views	a	page.	Competing	companies	submit	bids	for	this	particular	user	via	an	automated	
script and	the	best	bids	are	chosen	based	on	the	amount	of	the	bid	itself	and	other	relevant	
factors.	Due	to	the	high	frequency	and	speed	of	these	auctions,	this	mechanism	is	also	known	as	
real-time	bidding.	The	final	cost	to	a	winning	bidder	depends	on	the	level	of	competition	and	so	
can	vary	from	one	user	to	the	next.	The	cost	for	a	winning	bid	may be	charged	when	the	ad	is	
shown	(known	as	pay-per-impression)	or	when	the	user	clicks	on	it	(known	as	pay-per-click).
The	marketplace	for	online	advertising	is	complex.	Many	large	websites	offer	their	own	auction	
and	bidding	mechanisms	(such	as	Google	or	Facebook),	but	most	smaller	websites	outsource	the	
selling	of	their	advertising	space	to	ad	networks,	which	act	as	intermediaries	between large	
numbers	of	websites	and	advertisers.	In	order	to	deal	with	this	complexity,	many	businesses	rely	
on online	marketing	agencies, which strategically	participate	in	a	wide	range	of	ad	auctions	to	
maximise	their	client’s	return	on	investment.


Our customer	is	a	small	online	marketing	agency	that	designs	custom	advertising	campaigns	for	
its	clients.	The	agency would	like us to	develop a	tool	that	will	allow	its	clients	to	evaluate	the	
success	of	advertising	campaigns.	<br />

Specifically,	this	tool	reads	data	gathered	
during	campaigns	and	then	display	key	metrics	about	the	campaign	on	a	user-friendly	and	clear	
dashboard. Besides	providing	a	quick	summary	of	the	overall	performance	of	a	specific	campaign,	such	a	
dashboard	allows	the	agency’s	clients	to	view	performance	metrics	over	time	and	
within	particular	audience	segments or	contexts.	Such	fine-grained	information	about	
performance	allows	the	clients	to	detect	important	trends,	for	example,	revealing	times	of	the	
day	when customers	tend	to	respond	particularly	well	to	a	campaign,	identifying sudden changes	
in performance and	highlighting	the	most	engaged	audience	segments.
